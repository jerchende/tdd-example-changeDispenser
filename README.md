# Task

Write a class (ChangeDispenser) that is given an amount and then dispenses change as the optimum number of coins.

The class should make use of two interfaces
DenominationsRetriever - which lists the valid denominations
MonetaryItemDispenser - which can be used to dispense each individual coin

Assume you have enough stock of each coin to give change.
